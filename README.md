# fullstack-dev-journey
This repository tracks my complete full-stack web development journey. From HTML and CSS to JavaScript, Node.js, and Express, every folder documents hands-on practice, notes, and mini-projects. Built while learning from youtube, it reflects my consistent progress, growth, and passion for coding.
